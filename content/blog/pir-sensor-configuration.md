## Introduction
Sometime ago when I bought my very first PIR Sensor I've run into some troubles with it. I had some help but without proper configuration and some basics on how it actually works it would take much, much longer to get it right. This piece will work as a reminder for me and hopefully a shortcut for you to get the first PIR Sensor based project off the ground.

What I will be showing here is a little introduction into XXXX PIR Sensor. 

To understand how it works you will have to play with this for a while but it's crucial to set it up in a way that would give you results for most use cases.
