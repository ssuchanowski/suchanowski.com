      <description>As I personally decided that year 2018 will be a year of content for me it was about time to finally buy my first camera. I have spent some time on the research and this might help you if you have similar needs as I.
Main criteria I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be photography or videography pro and because of that, I was looking for a compact camera which won&amp;rsquo;t require much more investments as I will learn to use it and will find the new and more fitting way of using it.</description>
