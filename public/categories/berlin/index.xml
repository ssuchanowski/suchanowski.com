      <description>As all iOS developers know tickets for this year conference were booked almost immediately. At first, I thought that the scale of the event will be much bigger (however doing it in 9 cities is not piece of cake – if it all will be as well organized as the one in Germany). I&amp;rsquo;ve counted about 350 seats in the room where the KickOff part took place – as usual, started with some statistics – which is very typical for Apple.</description>
